                We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
                But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br>
                One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
                Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br>

            Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
            Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
